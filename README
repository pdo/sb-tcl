SB-TCL
======

An interface between SBCL Common Lisp and Tcl/Tk.  Uses the SBCL FFI
to load libtcl and libtk shared libraries, allowing Lisp code to
invoke Tcl commands and for Tcl commands to be implemented by Lisp
functions, passing data to and from Lisp and Tcl as needed.

Documentation still a work-in-progress, but in the meantime see the
test/simple-test.lisp source file for a couple of basic examples.

The main purpose of this project is to allow the easy creation of
Lisp-based applications with a GUI: the GUI is written in Tcl/Tk and
the application logic in Lisp.  There are no other external
dependencies.
